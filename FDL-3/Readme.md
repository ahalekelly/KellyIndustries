## FDL-3 Wheels

FDL-3 wheels for [Plus Motors](https://kellyindustries.us/collections/flywheel-parts/products/plus-motor-brushless). The design is parametric by adjusting the first sketch, you can adjust the crush and the height to make the wheels line up. I had to raise the wheels by 0.6mm, from 16.1mm to 16.7mm, to make them line up with my printer, I included STLs for standard and 0.5mm offset. Use M3x8mm screws (8mm and 9mm screws are included with Plus Motors) to mount the flywheels and M3x6mm screws to mount the motors. Requires the 1616 barrel outer parts from [the FDL-3 f3d file](https://github.com/projectfdl/FDL-3-Blaster/blob/master/CAD/FDL-3%20Main.f3d), under Nose Shorty > Misc.

A [Dettlaff](https://github.com/ahalekelly/Dettlaff) board can run an FDL-3, but there currently isn't enough space to fit the Dettlaff and a 4in1 ESC in the blaster. I'm working on an FDL-Gonk remix that will support Dettlaff and Plus Motors, or you can fit Dettlaff + individual ESCs in the battery tray and put the battery in a battery stock.
