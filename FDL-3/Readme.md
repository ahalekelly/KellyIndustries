## FDL-3 Wheels

FDL-3 wheels for [Plus Motors](https://kellyindustries.us/collections/flywheel-parts/products/plus-motor-brushless). The design is parametric by adjusting the first sketch, you can adjust the crush and the height to make the wheels line up. Use M3x8mm screws (8mm and 9mm screws are included with Plus Motors) to mount the flywheels and M3x6mm screws to mount the motors. Requires the 1616 barrel outer parts from [the FDL-3 f3d file](https://github.com/projectfdl/FDL-3-Blaster/blob/master/CAD/FDL-3%20Main.f3d).

A [Dettlaff](https://github.com/ahalekelly/Dettlaff) board can run an FDL-3, but there currently isn't enough space to fit both the electronics and the battery in the blaster, you can put the electronics in the battery tray and put the battery in a battery stock.
