# Colonel Wasp 76 AEG

![IMG_3602 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7078138/221446585-726217b1-f1c6-4436-8afb-cc8765c6fd5c.jpg)

Moving the grip forwards dramatically reduces the length of the blaster. Based on [this design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5278046) by dadiao123. Supports the original handle, but I prefer [this printed handle](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/aeg-ar15-pistol-motor-grip-1). You don't have to take apart the entire shell, to replace the mag release you can take out the front couple screws and pry the magwell open, and everything else mounts to the blaster externally.

Hardware required:

* 12x [M2.6 x 10mm toy screws](https://kellyindustries.us/products/m2-6-toy-screws-20x)
* 1x [4mm diameter x 50mm long Sex Bolt](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803808620064.html) for the middle pin (this listing calls it M4 because of the 4mm diameter but it actually has an M3 thread)

If you want to replace the other pins on your 76, you can buy the 22mm Sex Bolt for the front pin and the 35mm Sex Bolt for the rear pin.

The relocated grip works with the original front end, but I prefer the [Sillybutts shroud](https://github.com/Sillybutts/Colonel-Wasp-76-Mods/) which has a fixed barrel for better consistency, and I modified [this AFG by OnlyShellsRemain](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4949236) to mount directly to the shroud.

I'm not very good at aesthetics, so I welcome any remixes! I also included two different aesthetic options for the stock

I also designed a printed mag release for people who don't use the relocated grip.
