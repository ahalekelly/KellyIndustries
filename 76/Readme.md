# Colonel Wasp 76 AEG

Moving the grip forwards dramatically reduces the length of the blaster. Based on [this design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5278046) by dadiao123. Supports the original handle, but I prefer [this printed handle](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/aeg-ar15-pistol-motor-grip-1)

It works with the original front end, but the front end in the photo is the [Sillybutts shroud](https://github.com/Sillybutts/Colonel-Wasp-76-Mods/) which has a fixed barrel for better consistency, and I modified [this AFG by OnlyShellsRemain](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4949236) to mount directly to the shroud.

I also designed a printed mag release for people who don't use the relocated grip.
